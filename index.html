            <h1>Renjith Israel </h1>
            <h3>I am from Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala,India <span>with over 12 years of dedicated disaster response and national service experience. Despite overcoming personal challenges, I have actively participated and operated at the forefront in major national disasters, showcasing resilience and commitment to selfless voluntary service. You can reach me at +91 8075368489.</span></h3>

            <p class="line-spacing">"I have actively participated in numerous national disasters alongside esteemed entities like the Indian Army, Indian Navy, and NDRF-INDIA. Together, we executed rescue missions, saving lives and recovering bodies in the most perilous situations. My voluntary service also extends to collaborations with the Kerala Police during various calamities, including deep well rescues and operations to save both human and animal lives.

                In addition to my commitment to disaster relief, I have showcased my strength and skill in sports, participating three times in National championships in Body Building and Arm-Wrestling. Achieving the title of Jr. Mr. Trivandrum three times underscores my dedication to excellence. Despite facing personal challenges, including overcoming a brain disease in my early youth, I have consistently chosen national service over lucrative job opportunities abroad."</p>

            <h3>I love my Country</h3>
            <p class="line-spacing">I have received comprehensive training in Life Saving Techniques, Power Boat Operations, and Sea Rescue Squad from the Government of India National Institute of Water Sports. Additional training from the Defence institute Kashmir has equipped me with expertise in Wireless operations, Forest survival techniques, and Deep diving. I have invested in top-notch equipment from Italy and France to enhance the effectiveness of my rescue missions.

In addition to my training, my expertise extends to Tunnel Rescue operations, Deep Well Rescue, Flood Rescue operations, and Mountain Rescue. The diverse range of my skills allows me to navigate and respond effectively to emergencies in various environments and scenarios. I possess proficiency in Deep Jungle surviving techniques, showcasing my adaptability in challenging terrains.

Furthermore, my deep diving skills contribute to my effectiveness in water-based rescue operations, ensuring that I can reach and assist individuals in submerged or hard-to-reach areas. The inclusion of wireless operations in my skill set enhances my ability to coordinate and communicate seamlessly during rescue missions, critical for the success of operations.

My service record includes active participation in major disasters such as the 2013 Cloud bursting in Uttarakhand, 2018 Great Flood in Kerala, 2019 Nilambur Kavalappara Disaster in Kerala, 2020 Idukki Pettimudi Disaster in Kerala, 2021 Glacier burst in Uttarakhand, and the challenging 2022 Muthalapozhy Sea disaster in Kerala. Videos and news coverage of my recent rescue mission in the treacherous sea zone have garnered significant attention, highlighting the impact and importance of my work.

Despite the inherent risks and challenges, I remain dedicated to selfless voluntary service for the nation, utilizing my extensive skill set to contribute to the well-being of the community and the nation as a whole. </p>
